# Connect_four
Connect 4 Python game against a bot.
## How To Use
As this bot was designed to play other bots, the UI is pretty janky. DO NOT touch the pygame window, or it will just break. Simply resize or move the cmd window so that you can see both windows. type your desired collumn in the cmd window. Columns are indexed 0-6. The pygame window will update after you make your first move
## Info
This program was designed to be used in competition with other bots, and thus will assume its enemy is a perfect player.
It's not that good tbh - it can only recognise a handful of hard-coded scenarios and can only see a few moves ahead.
